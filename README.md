## Chaintask

App inspired in the "atomic habits" book. 📖

I'm right now working on optimize the use of my time in order to reach my life objectives. 👨🏼‍💻

After looking a lot of tools in the market only found tools that give me more distractions and don't help me with concentration on my taks. 💔

That's the reason that I start this repo, to create a simple tool with all the little tools that I use on my day to day and avoid to have a lot of tabs in browser for the same purpouse. 😵‍💫

I hope this tool help someone else as I expect it help to me. 🎉
